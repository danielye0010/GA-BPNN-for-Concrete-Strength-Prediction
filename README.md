# GA-BPNN for Compressive Strength Prediction in Construction Materials
Trained a BPnn model with two hidden layers based on a Kaggle dataset using PyTorch. Optimized the BPnn model 
using Genetic Algorithms to fine-tune and predict the 28-day compressive strength of construction materials with 
accuracy rank 155/500+ submissions.
